You can control it with a set of environment variables
- DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE: default 'djangochem.settings.docker'  
    - this docker.py settings file enables the 4 DB_* env variables set below.  Most likely, you want to leave it as is 

- DB_NAME: database name
- DB_USER: database user
- DB_PASSWORD: database password
- DB_HOST: the hostname of the psotgres server
- DJANGO_COMMAND: the string to pass after ./manage.py.  For example "test wcgrid" tests the wcgrid code.   


- to run tests:

        docker-compose -f compose-test.yml up

    this compose sets up a postgres server and hooks the django docker to it to run the test suite
